# JavaScript_Basics

This repo has four files:

1. JS_Basics: highlights the differences between Java and JavaScript for basic programming concepts, such as variable, functions, and intro to arrays and objects. This would hopefully help anyone who already knows Java but wants to learn JS easier!

2. JS_Arrays: highlights the core of JS array methods, sortings, and iterations. 

3. JS_Functions: explains more complicated features in JS functions, such as async/await and promises. 

4. JS_Objects: explains in-depth JS objects concepts, such as inheritance and prototype.
