# JavaScript Functions 

### JavaScript function syntax is more flexible and concise than Java. Although the concepts are universal, it's important to learn the tricks to write good JavaScript functions!

### In this document, we will cover:

    Arrow function
    Higher order function
    Callbacks
    Call/Bind
    This/IIFE
    Await/Async 
    Promise

#### What is arrow (=>) function and where should I use it?

* We can omit the "function" keyword and just use "=>" to seperate parameter(s) and "{"

* If the function has NO parameter:

      const noPara = () => {
        //statements;
      }

* If the function has ONE parameter:

      const onePara = para => {
        //statements;
      }
    
* If the function has more than one parameters:

      const multiPara = (a, b, c) => {
        //statements;
      }
